# DocPlot
DocPlot lets you rank documents by how closely they match arbitrary search queries. You can drag and drop any plain-text file. 

DocPlot is written in `Svelte` and `transformers.js`.

## To Do
- [ ] run tokenizer/model in service worker to prevent UI blocking
- [ ] support PDF, .docx, etc.
- [ ] per-chunk distance vs. averaged CLS distance
- [ ] model selector
